This project applied statistical testing to historical data from men’s and women’s international soccer matches. As an analyst at a leading online sports media company specializing in soccer coverage, I investigated whether women’s international matches resulted in more goals scored compared to men’s.

The question that this project analysis seeks to answer is: Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?

Null hypothesis: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's
Alternative hypothesis: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's
